# Dart Practice Notes

This repository contains my personal notes and practice code while learning the Dart programming language.  
It's part of my journey into Flutter development.

The content here includes basic syntax, functions, object-oriented concepts, and general Dart programming exercises.

> This is a learning-focused repo and may include rough notes or simple code samples.

## How Dart Works?

- **We write Dart code** in `.dart` files.
- Dart uses a compiler to **convert your code into machine code** (for apps) or JavaScript (for web).
- You run the program using the Dart SDK (`dart run filename.dart`).
- With Flutter, Dart code becomes a beautiful mobile/web/desktop app.

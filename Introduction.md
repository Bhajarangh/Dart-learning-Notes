# Introduction to Dart Programming

- Open-source general-purpose programming language, originally developed by **Google**.
- **Object-oriented language** with C-style syntax
- It supports programming concepts like i**nterfaces, classes.**
- Dart **doesn't support arrays**. Dart collections can be used to replicate data structures such as arrays, generics, and optional typing.

> Dart doesn't have a separate, special data type called 'array' like in C or Java. Instead, it uses the `List` class to do the same job.
